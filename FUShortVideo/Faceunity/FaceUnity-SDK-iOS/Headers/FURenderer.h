 \param data should point to contents of the "v2.bin" we provide
 \param ardata should point to contents of the "ar.bin" we provide
 \param package is the pointer to the authentication data pack we provide. You must avoid storing the data in a file.
	Normally you can just `#include "authpack.h"` and put `g_auth_package` here.
